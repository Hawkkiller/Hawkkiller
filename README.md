With over 3 years of commercial experience, I've been involved in various projects of varying size and difficulty, including B2B, Fintech, Social and IoT. I have a solid knowledge of building extensible, supportable and high-performing systems while understanding the business value. I prefer to work as part of a team, but it is also possible for me to work on my own. Focused on results and delivering clean, high-quality code.
